# What is the main action in the game 

Pac Madman is a game built around running from ghosts and collecting powerups. Designed with a topdown camera this game has the feel of many traditional 3rd person games with the intensity and thrill of interaction and levels.

Pac Madman adds to the action of the traditional arcade game with unique map environments, enemies and powerups to add a variety to the levels and more strategy.

- Control system (Player choices and level design)
  - Level progression (8 unique levels)
  - Maze-style maps
  - Powerups (4 unique pickups)
  - NPC design (unique AI)
- Score tracker
- Limited respawns (after 3 deaths you have to restart from the beginning)


# What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal

Working in Unreal streamlines alot of processes. Great parts where how easy it is to build a UI or menu and how no effort is required for simple AI pathfinding. However, the downsides where definitely visible as well.

Getting started in a new environment is always a learning curve and Unreal brought a new IDE, a new language (blueprints) and a new style of design (3D). Just knowing what to type into the search bars was hard and the official documentation is lacking for generic "how do I do this" type questions.

I found it quite difficult to know what I needed to know starting out but after a number of tutorials I started getting a feel for the way blueprints and UE4 was layed out and from there I could begin intelligently implementing features.

# What is the most interesting part of the game

For me the most interesting part was expanding beyond what normal pacman could do. Customisation and cool features included:

- Special effects (tornado's, glowing powerups, teleporters, terrain)
- 3D world interactions (collisions, jumping, on overlap events)
- Powerups (speed boosts, power pickups and even more interesting strategic pickups that you have to time right)
- Enemies (going beyond standard ghosts to whirlwinds that grow, terrain that attacks you, and even more)
- Levels (With 4 starter levels, 4 advanced levels and 4 randomized levels the game has a lot of playability!)

However, of the game's fun came through actually designing it. Using UE4 is incredibly powerful and lets you exponentially expand your aims for what you want to achieve in a game. Being able to express this creativity was really enjoyable.
